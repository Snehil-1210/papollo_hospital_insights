Papollo Hospitals — Power BI Practice Dashboard
Built a hospital operations dashboard on a practice dataset (7,157 admissions).
 Top insights: Total billed ₹190.43M | Avg bill ≈ ₹26.6K (median ₹12.3K) — right-skewed costs. Avg LOS = 8.25 days (median 5).
 Case mix is infection-heavy (Viral, Flu, Malaria, Typhoid, Pneumonia — ~96% of records). Bed split: Private 50% / General 33% / ICU 17%. Imaging (CT/MRI/Ultrasound) drives the largest billed amounts; blood tests/X-rays smaller share.
 Actionable: fast-track mild infectious cases, review imaging utilization, investigate high-cost outliers (ICU/procedures).
